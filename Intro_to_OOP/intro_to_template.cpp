/* [Introdution to Generic Programming -- via Template]
 * With templates, the idea is to pass a data type as a parameter so that 
 * you donâ€™t need to write the same function code for operating on different data types. 
 * For example, you might need a function that has to accept many different data types 
 * in order for it to perform some operations or other actions on those data types. 
 * Some of these actions can be dividing, sorting, etc. Rather than writing and 
 * maintaining the multiple function declarations, each accepting slightly different arguments, 
 * you can write one function and pass the argument types as parameters. 
 * At compile time, the compiler then expands the code using the types that are passed as parameters.
